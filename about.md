space_text: Omnia Bar & Bistro is a venue that serves up experiences for every mood.
  It’s cool, comfortable and eclectic in its ability to host everything from a bustling
  business lunch to an intimate dinner date. Like everything in this building, the
  venue has an air of elegance, yet it is grounded by the abundant greenery, variety
  of stone and leather textures and impressive collection of modern artwork. It’s
  a friendly ambience with just the right amount of fancifulness. The main dining
  room is a vibrant area flooded with natural lights provided by floor-to-ceiling
  windows looking out onto the landmark location. Its high ceilings are decorated
  with whimsical vines of greenery descending between majestic columns and providing
  a contrast to the bold marble bar and statement stone surfaces. The walls of Omnia
  display unique paintings by resident artist David Bromley and you’ll also come across
  his bronze sculptures as you venture into the second dining room, which provides
  a more intimate atmosphere set with old-school chandeliers, wooden floors and leather
  seating. Finally, the bistro invites you to immerse yourself in the culinary experience
  and enjoy front row seats to the Chef’s show at the restaurant’s third space – a
  smaller area with an open kitchen and surrounding seating that gives uninterrupted
  views of the kitchen team in their element.
