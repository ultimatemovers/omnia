- title: Good food
  text: "“So Omnia works. Omnia is delicious. Are you surprised, when the crew has
    been picked like a fantasy football team? I'm not, and I'm glad for South Yarra
    that another winner is on the cards.”"

  text: "“It's a glorious room; a soaring atrium filled with light and hanging greenery
    and David Bromley prints giving way to a lowceiling, cellar-like moody space opposite
    the open kitchen in which a phalanx of staff get on with feeding the 100-seater."
