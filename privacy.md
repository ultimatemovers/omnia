#### What is personal information?

Personal information is any information or an opinion, in any form and whether true or not, about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable. Examples include an individual's name, address, contact number and email address.

#### How does Omnia collect and hold your personal information?

Omnia will only collect personal information about you by lawful and fair means. Omnia collects personal information in a variety of ways. It is Omnia’s usual practice to collect personal information directly from you (or from your authorised representative), for example when:

– you enquire about or reserve a table; or

– communicate with us through correspondence, chats, email, or when you share information with us from other social applications, services or websites.

Sometimes we collect personal information about customers or potential customers from a third party or a publicly available source, or from marketing and similar lists legally acquired by us.

If you provide us with personal information about another person (such as a family member), please make sure that you have their consent to do so and that you tell them about this policy.

What kinds of personal information does Omnia collect and hold?

The kinds of personal information that we collect and hold about you will depend on the circumstances of collection.

For example, if you request a booking, we may collect your name, address, email address, telephone number and any other information required to provide you with the quote. If you deal with us in some other capacity (for example, as a provider, a supplier or a stakeholder), we may collect your name, contact details and any other information you choose to provide to us.

In general, we may collect the following personal information from you:

– name;

– mailing or street address;

– email address;

– telephone number and other contact details;

– credit card information;

– your device ID, device type, geo-location information, computer and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the sites, ad data, IP address and standard web log information;

– details of the bookings or services we have provided to you or that you have enquired about;

– any additional information relating to you that you provide to us directly through our website or app or indirectly through your use of our website or app or online presence or through other websites or accounts from which you permit us to collect information;

– information you provide to us through customer surveys; or

– any other personal information that may be required in order to facilitate your dealings with us.

If you provide your personal information to a third party (for example, to book a table) that information is collected and managed by those third parties. You should familiarise yourself with their privacy policy prior to deciding whether you wish to provide them with your information.

#### How does Omnia use your personal information?
