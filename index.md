    Our signature duck sourced locally from Macedon. Fourteen-day-dry-aged, honey roasted duck finished
    with a spiced jus served alongside a confit pressed duck leg, garnished with nashi pear. A dish for two,
    but we understand why you might not want to share. Let us take you on a visual and sensory experience
    from whole bird to final mouthful. A dish both reminiscent and new. A coming together of melt-in-your-
    mouth texture, bold yet balanced flavours, and a charm accented by a restrained attentiveness. A taste
    that tempts another visit, time and time again.
