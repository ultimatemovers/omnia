  section_description: |-
    Omnia blends the energy of a European bistro with the stories of Australia’s best growers
    and producers. A neo-traditional twist on culinary classics served with the warmth of old- world hospitality. Take a seat in our light filled Conservatory, cosy Barrel Room, or at the bar. A setting paired with a taste to answer the call of any occasion. A drink, a meal, or just dessert. You’re welcome anytime.

    Omnia Bistro makes its home at the base of Grand Capitol on the corner of Chapel Street and Toorak Road.

  section_title: New dishes
  section_description: Our signature duck sourced locally from Macedon. Fourteen-day-
    dry-aged, honey roasted duck finished with a spiced jus served alongside a confit
    pressed duck leg, garnished with nashi pear. A dish both reminiscent and new.
    A coming together of melt-in-your- mouth texture, bold yet balanced flavours,
    and a charm accented by a restrained attentiveness.
